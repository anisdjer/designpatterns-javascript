=========================

## Creational Patterns
#### Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes
#### Builder
Separates object construction from its representation
#### [Factory Method] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/factory)
Creates an instance of several derived classes
#### Prototype	
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
#### [Singleton](https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/singleton)
A class of which only a single instance can exist
## Structural Patterns
#### Adapter	
Match interfaces of different classes
#### [Bridge] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/bridge)	
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
#### [Composite] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/composite)	
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
#### Decorator	
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
#### Facade	
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
#### [Flyweight] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/flyweight)	
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
#### Proxy	
An object representing another object
## Behavioral Patterns
#### [Chain of Resp.] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/chain_of_responsibility)	
A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
#### Command	
Encapsulate a command request as an object
#### Interpreter	
A way to include language elements in a program
#### Iterator	
Sequentially access the elements of a collection
#### [Mediator] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/mediator)	
Defines simplified communication between classes
#### [Memento] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/memento)	
Capture and restore an object's internal state
#### Observer	
A way of notifying change to a number of classes
#### [State] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/state)	
Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
#### Strategy	
Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
#### Template Method	
Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
#### [Visitor] (https://github.com/anisdjer/designpatterns-javascript/tree/master/visitor)
Defines a new operation to a class without change
